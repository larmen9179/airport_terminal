# airport_terminal

This was an old project I touched up and recently published as of August 2023. 

The goal of this program is to replicate purchasing flights like you would at an airport terminal using string methods. The language I chose to use for this project was Java. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you were to run this file on your machine, make sure you change the file location for "flights.txt". 

For example, I have my "flights.txt" file located at "C:/Users/lojor/OneDrive/Desktop/1101/flights.txt" in my airport_terminal.java file because that where it is located on MY machine. You will HAVE to change this for your machine.
